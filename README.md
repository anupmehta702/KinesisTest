**Steps to run Kinesis producer consumer using KCL KPL library**
<br /> 1. Create a user on AWS and ensure he has Kinesis full access. Copy the accessKey and secretKey and configure it in aws cli using "aws configure"
<br /> 2. Create a stream called "StockRecordStream"
<br /> 3. Run StockTradeWriter to produce a record
<br /> 4. Run StockTradeReaderConfiguration to consume the message sent in step 2

**Steps to run CDC related code**
**Aim** - Generate CDC events for a DynamoDB table and insert into into a S3 bucket
<br /> 1. Create a table called "customer" in DynamoDB
<br /> 2. Create a Kinesis data stream named "CustomerCdcStream"
<br /> 3. Also create an S3 bucket named "anupmehts702". This the bucket where it would create a file and insert CDC content of "customer" table
<br /> 4. Add/Update/Delete record in table from aws UI. This would generate an event in the data stream. 
<br /> 5. Run V2CustomerCdcReader.java 
<br /> 6. It first creates a local csv file named "cdcCustomer.csv". 
and then updates the file on S3 with same file name
<br /> 7. YOu can use BucketOperation class to read and download the uploaded file in step 6 by running BucketOperation.downloadObject() method
